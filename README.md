# ANSYS Static & Transient Analysis

This repository contains the report and presentation for a basic Static and Transient Structural Analysis performed in ANSYS Workbench.

## Files Included
- **ANSYS_Report.docx** – Analysis report  
- **ANSYS_Presentation.pptx** – Presentation slides  
- **Screenshots** – Images of geometry, mesh, loads, and results (if added)

## Description
A pentagon-shaped 3D model was created and analyzed under:
- **Static load** with a fixed support and one remote force  
- **Transient load** with multiple time-dependent forces  

Material used in both analyses: **ME-1900 (steel type)**.

The screenshots show:
- Geometry  
- Meshing  
- Boundary conditions  
- Equivalent stress results  
- Load vs time graph (transient)  

## Purpose
This project was completed for academic learning to understand:
- How structures behave under static loading  
- How time-varying forces affect the model in transient analysis
